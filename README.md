## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)), that I am porting an old calendar app into. I loved the look of my calendar, and used it for tracking things. But it was made a while back with CRA, and I want to update it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
